# BozLights
Your one-stop-shop for lights and siren controls, BozLights is a modified version of [Lt.Caine's original script](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-luxart-vehicle-control/17304), featuring a plethora of new content, including:

- New configuration file
- A plethora of popular real sirens built in
- Ability to select siren tones by pressing the 1-4 keys
- Toggleable rumbler system for some siren models (including the vanilla siren)
- Seperate manual tones for some sirens (including the vanilla siren)
- An ELS/DLS-like light stage system (requires cars to be specifically designed for this feature, no documentation yet)
- Bindable key to toggle bomb doors (for NYPD/NYSP-style highrisers)

## Keyboard Controls:

- Q = Toggle emergency lights / Next light stage
- Left Alt = Toggle siren
- E (Double-press) = Toggle Siren
- E = Horn / Switch between wail or yelp (only on cars with hornSwitcher enabled in config and sirens running)
- R = Manual siren / Switch between wail or yelp
- 1 = Wail
- 2 = Yelp
- 3 = Priority
- 4 = Extra tone (usually a hi-lo)
- 5 = Auxiliary siren (dual siren)
- 6 = Rumbler
- _ = Left indicator
- = = Right indicator
- Backspace = Hazard lights

It's still compatible with controller, I'm just not sure of the controls since I regularly play with keyboard.

## Controller Controls
- Right D-Pad = Emergency Lights
- Down D-Pad = Toggle Siren
- Left Thumbstick Down = Horn / Switch Between Tones with HornSwitcher enabled
- B = Manual / Siren Swap
