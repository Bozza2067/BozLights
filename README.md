## End of support
I'm no longer working on this mod, and will not be providing support for it. Pull requests are accepted and encouraged.
If you want to add new sirens, I've included everything you need to do just that. Requires CodeWalker for .rel editing, and OpenIV for .awc editing.

# BozLights
Your one-stop-shop for lights and siren controls, BozLights is a modified version of [Lt.Caine's original script](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-luxart-vehicle-control/17304), featuring a plethora of new content, including:

- New configuration file
- A plethora of popular real sirens built in
- Ability to select siren tones by pressing the 1-4 keys
- Toggleable rumbler system for some siren models (including the vanilla siren)
- Seperate manual tones for some sirens (including the vanilla siren)
- An ELS/DLS-like light stage system (requires cars to be specifically designed for this feature, no documentation yet)
- Bindable key to toggle bomb doors (for NYPD/NYSP-style highrisers)
- Everything you need to customize the selection of sirens as you need.

## Keyboard Controls:

- Q = Toggle emergency lights / Next light stage
- Left Alt = Toggle siren
- E (Double-press) = Toggle Siren
- E = Horn / Switch between wail or yelp (only on cars with hornSwitcher enabled in config and sirens running)
- R = Manual siren / Switch between wail or yelp
- 1 = Wail
- 2 = Yelp
- 3 = Priority
- 4 = Extra tone (usually a hi-lo)
- 5 = Auxiliary siren (dual siren)
- 6 = Rumbler
- _ = Left indicator
- = = Right indicator
- Backspace = Hazard lights

It's still compatible with controller, I'm just not sure of the controls since I regularly play with keyboard.

## Controller Controls
- Right D-Pad = Emergency Lights
- Down D-Pad = Toggle Siren
- Left Thumbstick Down = Horn / Switch Between Tones with HornSwitcher enabled
- B = Manual / Siren Swap
